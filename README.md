## CGAN based on DCGAN

### 1. Network: Unet with picture oon
: I convert from keras to pytorch, and change squeezeNet with VGG16.

→ I'll load soon siames network, triplet network, arcface network (backbone network: SqueezeNet(based on ResNet101), ResNet50)

→ Few shot based. I'm excecuting above project in progress

### 2. Dataset: MNIST
> supported pytorch

>

### 3. Reference
a. "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition" (Karen Simonyan, Andrew Zisserman)

> Forked from "https://github.com/normandipalo/faceID_beta.git" (normandipalo/faceID_beta)
